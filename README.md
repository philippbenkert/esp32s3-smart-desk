ESP32S3 Smart Desk
The ESP32S3 Smart Desk is a project that aims to provide smart control over a desk setup using an ESP32S3 microcontroller. This project integrates with MQTT to control various devices such as relays and motors, allowing for remote control over Wi-Fi.

Features
Control relays for devices like monitors, laptops, fans, and more.
Control a motor to adjust the height of the desk.
Set specific runtimes for the motor to move the table up or down.
Receive feedback and error messages via MQTT.
Easily connect to Wi-Fi and MQTT server.
Setup
Hardware Requirements
ESP32S3 microcontroller
Relay module (with at least 6 relays)
Motor for adjusting the desk height
Shift register (74HC595)
Necessary jumper wires and breadboard
Software Requirements
Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
PubSubClient library for MQTT
ShiftRegister74HC595 library for controlling the shift register
Wiring
SER_Pin: 7
RCLK_Pin: 5
SRCLK_Pin: 6
Connect the shift register pins to the ESP32S3 as mentioned above. Connect the outputs of the shift register to the relay module.

Configuration
Set your Wi-Fi SSID and password in the main code.
Set the MQTT server IP and port.
Adjust the relay and motor control pins if necessary.
Usage
Once the setup is complete, power on the ESP32S3. It will automatically connect to the specified Wi-Fi network and the MQTT server.

You can send MQTT messages to control the relays and the motor. Here are the available topics and payloads:

/relay/monitor: "on" or "off"
/relay/laptop: "on" or "off"
/relay/fan: "on" or "off"
/relay/reserve2: "on" or "off"
/motor/table: "up", "down", or "stop"
/motor/runtimeup: (integer value for runtime in milliseconds)
/motor/runtimedown: (integer value for runtime in milliseconds)
For example, to turn on the monitor relay, send "on" to the /relay/monitor topic.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:

Ensure that the Wi-Fi and MQTT credentials are correct.
Check the wiring connections.
Monitor the serial output for any error messages or feedback.
Ensure that the MQTT server is running and reachable from the ESP32S3.
